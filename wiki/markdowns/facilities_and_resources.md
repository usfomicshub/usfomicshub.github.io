# FACILITIES AND RESOURCES

**Laboratory:**  The USF Genomics Core laboratory facilities are on the 3rd floor of the Interdisciplinary Research Building (IDRB) in the USF Research Park.  The ~3000 sq. ft. BSL2 laboratory space is equipped for cell biological and molecular biological experiments. The USF Genomics Core facility offers/encourages one-on-one consultation with a team of experienced bench and computational scientists on experimental design, sample preparation and data analysis for USF researchers. 

The USF Genomics Core laboratory facilities house the following instrumentation:
_Next-Gen Sequencers:_ Illumina NextSeq-550 and MiSeq systems, 10x Chromium Single-Cell Controller.

_Instrumentation for sample library-prep and quality-assurance:_ Covaris M220 for DNA framentation, Agilent 4200 and 2200 TapeStation systems, Roche LightCycler Real-Time qPCR system, Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 fluorometer, and BioRad PCR systems.

_Instrumentation for cell culture:_ Three four-foot class II biosafety cabinets, four mixed-gas incubators, two Leica microscopes, one Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge.

These facilities are additionally fully equipped with refrigerators, -20°C and -80°C freezers, thermocyclers, bench top centrifuges, heatblocks, and vortexers.

**Computational:** The USF Genomics Core computational facilities are on the 4th floor of the IDRB and comprise a 1400+ sq. ft. computational suite shared with Genomics Program members in addition to private offices. Genomics Core computational consultants run many Mac, Linux and Dell workstations and have access to USF’s High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and a variety of both proprietary and open-source analysis software. Additional details are available at http://rc.usf.edu. HPC infrastructure and hardware supporting USF Genomics and the USF Genomics Core Facility is managed by the USF Department of Research Computing.

Data storage and analysis: Data to be generated and analyzed by the Core are securely stored on a 1000-core HIPAA-compliant cluster, and genomics program researchers have priority access to HPC and a 9152-core general-computation cluster with multi-core servers located in the on-campus datacenter. The total of 419 nodes have a memory of 46,228 GB RAM. The nodes in the cluster are connected with either a QDR InfiniBand fabric (older hardware) or an Intel Omnipath fabric (newer hardware) for computations as well as a separate Ethernet-management network.  All nodes in the clusters are connected (over either QDR Infiniband or Omnipath) to a 2.1~PB GPFS system or a 300 TB BeeGFS system (dedicated to the HIPAA-compliant cluster). The HPC clusters also have close to 100 nodes outfitted with Nvidia GPU resources with a total of 222 GPUs in production.

**Genomics Training Courses and consultation:** The USF Genomics Program offers both laboratory- and computational- workshops for Next-Gen sequencing and data analysis through the Core Facility and its USF Omics Hub, a core group of PhD-level laboratory and computational biologists with extensive and varied experience with omics experiments from the bench to data-analysis. The Hub are available for consultations to support project-planning, experimental design, and cost estimates, as well as longer-term collaboration on funded projects.
