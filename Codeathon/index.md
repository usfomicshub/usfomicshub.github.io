## What is it?

The One Health Codeathon at USF* serves to bring together a diverse set researchers and clinicians, including students, faculty, and postdocs, for an intense 3-day data science focused hackathon. Transdisciplinary teams will integrate their skillsets in order to solve emerging problems related to human and environmental health in a global setting. 

Each team consisting of specialists in data sciences, microbiomes, health and social sciences â€” will work to uncover microbiome interactions across the globe by integrating genetics, genomics, clinical data, and geosocial sciences. Teams will work on projects synergistically to answer questions related to the topic. 

## Program Overview

The 3-day codeathon will begin with a series of talks regarding the event, its purpose, and the significance of the problems being investigated. Teams will initiate work on their projects following the talks Wednesday afternoon and will have the entirety of Thursday along with Friday morning to complete their work. Friday afternoon, each team will present their work and an award will be given based on the evaluations of an external review panel.
