## Main Objectives: 

⬣ Can we track human migratory history with the patterns of microbiome evolution?

⬣ Are human geographical differences reflected in microbiota differentiations and adaptations?

⬣ Is there a diaspora microbiota unifying human social and culture entities?


## Updates

- A closing-ceremony announcement from Dr. Rays Jiang:

"What a fabulous tournament — I am speechless. Congratulations Team ZERO and Team Animal again. ALL teams (in alphabetical order), Team GEO, Team PublixPower, Team TRACK, and Team YOLO excelled in data science problem solving, cross-field communication, and top-notch team working. The judges are impressed by the scope and results coming out of this event. We will re-convene after work over drinks, to celebrate our camaraderie. Swamy will update you with the details in a link. Three cheers to our collective sweat, stress and joy!"

- Dr. Elizabeth Miller's Codeathon-opening Anthropology in microbiome-research presentation provides important context for the power and necessity of interdisciplinary approaches to answer the complex questions inherent to human microbiomes-research--check it out!
